    <h2 class="intro-header__title">What are Zombie Sciences?</h2><br>
    <p class="intro__content-desc">"The ultimate mark of power may be its invisibility; the ultimate challenge, the exposition of its roots.” - Michel-Rolph Trouillot, Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History <br><br><br>

    "Organizers campaigning against carceral technologies are not organizing against ‘intense creepiness.’ They are organizing against a category of violence...that has a long history of racialized surveillance, and a short history of digital surveillance." - Sarah T. Hamid, Carceral Tech Resistance Network (CTRN) <br><br><br><br>

    Year after year, century after century, violent and nonsensical scientific ideas are cut down and put to rest—only to return deadlier than ever and with alluring new names. Nazis called it eugenics, but today scientists call it sociogenomics. Colonial anthropologists called it craniology and gentleman scientists called it physiognomy, but today’s hottest research papers call it biometrics. Researchers of yore claimed that violent behavior stemmed from extra-large Y chromosomes, but today’s computer scientists say it’s encoded in faces and voices. <br><br>

    These zombie sciences, old and new, are cut from the same sullied cloth. Despite changes in terminology and methods, zombie sciences are all predicated on the construction of people as inherently inferior, undesirable, dangerous, and disposable. On top of these claims, members of dominant groups build technologies to capture and control these “deviant” and “delinquent” classes. <br><br>

    The ghoulish remnants of this violent past lingers on in today’s slick interfaces and algorithms. These bloody histories are often sanitized through a technocratic rhetoric which now frames machine learning and “big data” as innovative and cutting-edge, objective, and rigorous. But it’s the same deadly shit—reanimated, haggard, and back to haunt us. <br><br>

    Our timeline traces the legacy of these grotesque ideas–and the acts carried out in their name–revealing how carceral biometrics (e.g. physiognomy, phrenology) and the sciences of social control (e.g. behaviorism, eugenics) are alive and well today. They are the lifelines that keep undead ideas alive. <br><br>

        <p class="carceral__content-desc">Researchers recently announced plans to use artificial intelligence (AI) to gather and analyze biometric data such as heart rate and galvanic skin response, all in order to identify and intervene on “risky behaviors, stressful situations and other behavioral and physiological factors that lead toward recidivism.” While the stated goal of the project is to use technology to teach better coping and life skills to prevent people from committing crimes, the project’s focus--intervening on “behavioral and physiological factors correlated with...criminal behavior”--follows a long history of statisticians like Pearson and Galton who aim to minimize “undesirable behavior” by drawing connections between racialized biometrics and criminality.

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement - Jensen</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Eugenics made a comeback in the late 1960's, coinciding with a white backlash against government programs designed to close racial gaps in education, health and employment. Jensen's  Harvard Educational Review article argued that compensatory education programs like Project Head Start were no match for the fundamental genetic limitations in poor Black populations, an argument that revived interest in the influence of genetics on intelligence and justified  divestment from essential public services.</p>

        <p class="social_control__content-desc">In 1866 the Massachusetts Board of State Charities wrote that the chief cause for such a 'large proportion of dependent and destructive members of our community' was 'inherited organic imperfection, vitiated constitution or <i>poor stock</i>.' This proclamation is an early expression of the notion that certain classes of people are inherently flawed, deviant, undeserving, and unworthy members of society  and ought to, for the betterment of humankind, be disposed of or no longer exist.</p>

        <p class="social_control__content-desc">In this text, Galton coined the term 'eugenics,' from the Greek prefix <i>eu</i> ('well' or 'good') to describe the idea of using social control (i.e. forced sterilization, housing displacement, behavioral engineering,  etc.) to improve the health and intelligence of future generations. The violence, genocide, and oppression carried out in the name of eugenics demonstrates how ostensibly positive-seeming metrics to evaluate things like 'health' and 'intelligence” can be used to justify violence against stigmatized groups.</p>

These experts argued that it made no sense to invest in more opportunities for children of lower socioeconomic groups, because those children supposedly did not have the in-born ability to compete. Proponents of IQ testing believed in the primacy of heredity over environment and that the immigration of 'inferior' races (anyone not from Scandania or Western Europe) was driving America toward a dysgenic future.</p>

Germans who were tried for genocide after the war cited California's eugenic sterilization law as part of their defense. 60,000 people were forcibly sterilized under California's law.  Eugenic policies fell out of favor for some time after the revelation of these horrific crimes against humanity.</p>

Skinner argued that humans don't really think — they just passively respond to environmental cues, a theory that was framed as a progressive alternative to eugenics at the time. Nevertheless, Skinner's therapeutic approaches (i.e. operant conditioning) emphasized totalizing control at the expense of agency and choice. Skinner's early work provided the theoretical underpinnings for the field of  behavioral engineering, which has been  foundational to the development of coercive and dangerous techniques for eliminating deviancy ('curing autism,' 'converting homosexuals' etc.)</p>

The articles published in its pages fueled arguments in favor of eugenics policies, while keeping alive the notion of an 'undeserving poor' who would never improve or thrive regardless of the resources invested in their wellbeing.</p>

Jensen's  Harvard Educational Review article argued that compensatory education programs like Project Head Start were no match for the fundamental genetic limitations in poor Black populations, an argument that revived interest in the influence of genetics on intelligence and justified  divestment from essential public services.</p>

The authors claimed that evidence pointed 'toward a genetic factor in cognitive ethnic differences,' which drove persistent inequality across racial groups. This line of thinking was used to justify ongoing divestment of educational resources from low income and African American children.</p>

In 2004, neuroscientist Michael Meaney and geneticist Moshe Szyf led a team to study how early life experiences shape a person’s brain and  influence physical health and behavior later in life. This paper echoes earlier eugenics thinking by providing a gene-based mechanism for understanding how structural conditions like poverty translate into low educational achievement.</p>

Concerns have already arose that digital pills could become a requirement for probation or release from involuntary hospitalization, which is magnified by the already-prevalent use of psychotropic drugs that have been used to control inmates across the US prison, military, and welfare systems. Abilify, an antipsychotic, is the first drug approved as a digital pill. In many ways, this research represents the contemporary, 'cutting-edge' of  behavioral engineering.</p>
