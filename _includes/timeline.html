    <h2 class="intro-header__title">What are Zombie Sciences?</h2><br>
    <p class="intro__content-desc">"The ultimate mark of power may be its invisibility; the ultimate challenge, the exposition of its roots.” - Michel-Rolph Trouillot, Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History <br><br><br>

    "Organizers campaigning against carceral technologies are not organizing against ‘intense creepiness.’ They are organizing against a category of violence...that has a long history of racialized surveillance, and a short history of digital surveillance." - Sarah T. Hamid, Carceral Tech Resistance Network (CTRN) <br><br><br><br>

    Year after year, century after century, violent and nonsensical scientific ideas are cut down and put to rest—only to return deadlier than ever and with alluring new names. Nazis called it eugenics, but today scientists call it sociogenomics. Colonial anthropologists called it craniology and gentleman scientists called it physiognomy, but today’s hottest research papers call it biometrics. Researchers of yore claimed that violent behavior stemmed from extra-large Y chromosomes, but today’s computer scientists say it’s encoded in faces and voices. <br><br>

    These zombie sciences, old and new, are cut from the same sullied cloth. Despite changes in terminology and methods, zombie sciences are all predicated on the construction of people as inherently inferior, undesirable, dangerous, and disposable. On top of these claims, members of dominant groups build technologies to capture and control these “deviant” and “delinquent” classes. <br><br>

    The ghoulish remnants of this violent past lingers on in today’s slick interfaces and algorithms. These bloody histories are often sanitized through a technocratic rhetoric which now frames machine learning and “big data” as innovative and cutting-edge, objective, and rigorous. But it’s the same deadly shit—reanimated, haggard, and back to haunt us. <br><br>

    Our timeline traces the legacy of these grotesque ideas–and the acts carried out in their name–revealing how carceral biometrics (e.g. physiognomy, phrenology) and the sciences of social control (e.g. behaviorism, eugenics) are alive and well today. They are the lifelines that keep undead ideas alive. <br><br>

        <p class="carceral__content-desc">Blumenbach proposed that there were five fundamentally distinct variants of human beings, all distinguishable by skull shape and size. He believed that Caucasians (white Europeans) were the “original” race of the earliest humans on earth and that all other racial groups could reverse their “degeneration” and become Caucasian through proper environmental control, a notion that rationalized white supremacy and gave settler colonial and imperial projects a benevolent veneer.</p>

        <p class="carceral__content-desc">Settlers of the Americas used books like Morton’s Crania America to justify the removal of Native people from their land in the 1830’s and 40’s. Morton’s study of skulls was cited in various articles targeted at white settlers moving out west. One article stated that Native people were “adverse to cultivation, slow in acquiring knowledge”  and thus not conducive to industrialization and “progress.” This research helped to justify Andrew Jackson’s forceful relocation of 60,000 Indigenous peoples in a series of death marches commonly known as the “Trail of Tears.”</p>

Phrenological manuals on marriage proved incredibly popular. As Coombs argued: “One of the first requisites in a good wife is to ascertain that she has a good head.” Particular attention was paid to the phrenological indicators of child-rearing and sexuality. </p>

        <p class="carceral__content-desc">William Herbert Sheldon developed a theory of “somatotypes,” which were a set of general body shapes that could be used as indicators of intelligence, personality, or moral character. Sheldeon developed these typologies by relying on nude photos of freshman college students which were taken under the guise of “posture correction,” which he used to create theories about how to predict a person’s potential for criminality or leadership.</p>

These theories posit that there are multiple origins to the human race and that Black bodies are genetically distinct and inferior, which Agassiz and his supporters use to justify chattel slavery.</p>

The underlying assumption is that certain kinds of features represent qualitatively distinct types or categories of people--like the "superlatively scientific" face of race scientist J.F. Blumenbach. This work has been used to justify the hierarchical ranking of humans according to race, gender, ability, class, etc.</p>

The authors assert that their research subjects were able to distinguish criminals from non-criminals based on photos alone, even after controlling for things like gender, race, age, attractiveness, and emotional displays. By normalizing “what a criminal looks like,” this study only re-entrenches many existing biases that connect physical difference with danger and moral character.

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Eugenics made a comeback in the late 1960's, coinciding with a white backlash against government programs that were intended to close racial gaps in education, health and employment. Jensen’s Harvard Educational Review article argued that compensatory education programs like Project Head Start were no match for the fundamental genetic limitations in poor Black populations, an argument that revived interest in the influence of genetics on intelligence and justified divestment from essential public services.</p>

        <p class="social_control__content-desc">In the United States, a widespread eugenics movement led to the forced sterilization of tens of thousands of people considered “unfit” to reproduce. Indiana passed the first of these laws in 1907. By the end of the 1920s, twenty-four states passed laws permitting the involuntary sterilization of people perceived to be “mentally unfit.”</p>

The ERO analysed ranges of physical to tempermantal properites through questionnaires with "a commitment to improve race-betterment." In the US, ERO work (propoganda) led to forced sterilization of individuals with "undesirable" characteristics.</p>

        <p class="social_control__content-desc">In the 1920’s a group of psychologists touted IQ tests as a means of justifying unequal educational resources and outcomes. These experts argued that it made no sense to invest in more opportunities for children of lower socioeconomic groups, because those children supposedly did not have the in-born ability to compete. Proponents of IQ testing believed in the primacy of heredity over environment and that the immigration of “inferior” races (anyone not from Scandania or Western Europe) was driving America toward a dysgenic future.</p>

Germans who were tried for genocide after the war cited California’s eugenic sterilization law as part of their defense. 60,000 people were forcibly sterilized under California’s law.  Eugenic policies fell out of favor for some time after the revelation of these horrific crimes against humanity.</p>

The founders include the former Nazi scientist Otmar von Verschuer, British eugenicist Roger Pearson, along with Robert Gayre, Henry Garrett, Corrado Gini, and Reginald Ruggles Gates. The articles published in its pages fueled arguments in favor of eugenics policies, while keeping alive the notion of an “undeserving poor” who would never improve or thrive regardless of the resources invested in their wellbeing.</p>

The aim of this work was to course correct people’s in-born deficiencies through “observing and possibly controlling behavior at a distance.”</p>

Jensen’s Harvard Educational Review article argued that compensatory education programs like Project Head Start were no match for the fundamental genetic limitations in poor Black populations, an argument that revived interest in the influence of genetics on intelligence and justified divestment from essential public services.</p>

        <p class="social_control__content-desc">The field of epigenetics has renewed notions of “the undeserving poor” and has been used to justify the elimination of programs and policies designed to bridge achievement gaps in education as well as the dehumanizing treatment of people with disabilities. In 2004, neuroscientist Michael Meaney and geneticist Moshe Szyf led a team to study how early life experiences shape a person’s brain and  influence physical health and behavior later in life. This paper echoes earlier eugenics thinking by providing a gene-based mechanism for understanding how poverty translates into low educational achievement.

Abilify, an antipsychotic, is the first drug approved as a digital pill.
